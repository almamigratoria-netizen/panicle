Look at something like "stylelint"
{github.com/stylelint/stylelint)

Make it parse, format, correct, lint all in the browser (no server).
Host the project in github pages.

Also json5 lint, html5 lint, 
css indenter, css compactor, etc, etc.
A good collection of simple tools like this would be handy for a PiZero
but also just in general.  And a few good tools on a webpage are
a decent resume.
