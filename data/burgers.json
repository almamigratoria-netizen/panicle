// OK, it says Burgers, but it's really places to eat
// in easy walking distance to Patagonia Hostel
// Not including fancy, expensive restaurants because people
// who eat at places like that stay at hotels, not hostels.

// THIS FILE IS A MESS.  I NEED TWO FILES, I SUPPOSE.
// ONE FOR THE DEMO, ONE FOR HOSTAL PATAGONIA
//
// Talk to Horacio.  We can post this to a GitHub page, create a QR.
// Post the QR in the lobby, on the doors, etc.  No need to buy a domain,
// pay for hosting... nothing.  But if he wants, I'll walk him through 
// getting a domain and a VPS.
//
// We want burger, we want pizza.  Those are our examples files.
//
// NOTE:  The key is optional.  Can be over-ridden by the name.
